Your task:
- Analyze which tool outputs contain data directly relevant to answering the query
- Select only the outputs that are necessary - avoid selecting irrelevant data
- Consider the query's specific requirements (ticker symbols, time periods, metrics, etc.)
- Return a JSON object with a "context_ids" field containing a list of IDs (0-indexed) of relevant outputs

Example:
If the query asks about "Apple's revenue", select outputs from tools that retrieved Apple's financial data.
If the query asks about "Microsoft's stock price", select outputs from price-related tools for Microsoft.

- Capture the key information and data points from the answer
- Include specific entities mentioned (company names, ticker symbols, metrics)
- Be useful for determining if this answer is relevant to future queries

Example input:

Your task:
- Analyze which previous conversations contain context relevant to understanding or answering the current query

- Select only messages that would help provide context for the current query

- Identify specific metrics mentioned (e.g., "P/E ratio", "revenue", "profit margin")

## Task Types

- use_tools: Task needs to fetch data using tools (e.g., get stock prices, financial metrics)
- reason: Task requires LLM to analyze, compare, synthesize, or explain data

## Rules

1. MAXIMUM 6 words per task description
2. Use 2-5 tasks total
3. Set taskType correctly:
   - "use_tools" for data fetching tasks (e.g., "Get AAPL price data")
   - "reason" for analysis tasks (e.g., "Compare valuations")
4. Set dependsOn to task IDs that must complete first
   - Reasoning tasks usually depend on data-fetching tasks

## Examples

GOOD task list:
- task_1: "Get NVDA financial data" (use_tools, dependsOn: [])
- task_2: "Get peer company data" (use_tools, dependsOn: [])
- task_3: "Compare valuations" (reason, dependsOn: ["task_1", "task_2"])

Return JSON with:
- summary: One sentence (under 10 words)
- tasks: Array with id, description, taskType, dependsOn`;

5. Provide brief ANALYSIS when relevant

## Format

- Use plain text ONLY - NO markdown (no **, *, _, #, etc.)
- Use line breaks and indentation for structure
- Present key numbers on separate lines
- Keep sentences clear and direct

Your job is to evaluate whether we have gathered enough information to fully answer the user's query.

Current date: {current_date}

## Your Task

Analyze:
1. The original query and what the user is asking for
2. What tasks have been completed and what data was gathered
3. Whether there are gaps in the information needed to provide a complete answer

## Decision Criteria

Mark as COMPLETE (isComplete: true) if:
- All key data points needed to answer the query are available
- The query can be answered comprehensively with current data
- Further data gathering would not materially improve the answer
- When complete: set missingInfo to [] and suggestedNextSteps to ""

Mark as INCOMPLETE (isComplete: false) if:
- Critical data is missing (e.g., asked about comparison but only have one company's data)
- The query requires analysis that depends on data not yet gathered
- There are clear follow-up data needs to fully answer the question
- When incomplete: populate missingInfo with specific missing data points and suggestedNextSteps with guidance

## Important Rules

- Be thorough but not excessive - don't require perfection
- Consider whether missing data is essential vs nice-to-have
- Be pragmatic about what's achievable within the iteration limit
- If we've made 2+ attempts and still missing data, prefer completing with available info

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with:
- isComplete: boolean - true if ready to answer, false if more work needed
- reasoning: string - explanation of your decision
- missingInfo: string[] - list of specific missing data points (empty array [] if complete)
- suggestedNextSteps: string - guidance for next iteration (empty string "" if complete)`;
